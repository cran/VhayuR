
Main user functions are (see sample scripts):

VhayuRgetData.zoo 
VhayuRgetData.data.frame
VhayuRgetData.list - Vhayu only not files
VhayuRgetData.matrix - Vhayu only not files

VhayuRoptions
VhayuRgetOption

Last two work same as options/getOption in R so anyone familiar
with R would know how to use them immeidately.

VFQconnect loads dll and connects to server but this is automatically
done by the other routines too if its not loaded so it never has to
be invoked.

VhayuRfindDLL() will find the location of the DLL using looking
in the paths defined in the datapath option or in some common
locations if not.

VhayuRflexrecdef() gives names of all flex recs and with the name 
as the single argument it gives an unformatted definition.
